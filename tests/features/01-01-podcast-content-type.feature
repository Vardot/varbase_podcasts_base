Feature: Podcasts Base - Podcast and Podcast episode content types
      As a Content editor
      I want a Podcast content type for the show and a Podcast episode content type for each episode
      So that I can publish a show once and add its episodes, with their audio, under it.

  @regression @local @development @staging @production
  Scenario: The Podcast add form describes the show, with no audio of its own
    Given I am a logged in user with the "Content editor" user
     When I go to "/node/add/podcast"
     Then the page title should contain "Create Podcast"
      And I see visible podcast title field
      And the field "#edit-title-0-value" should be required
      And the field "Summary" should be required
      And I should see "Cover art"
      And I should see "Host"
      And I should see "Listen on"
      And I don't see audio media button, duration field, episode number field, podcast reference field

  @regression @local @development @staging @production
  Scenario: The Podcast episode add form asks for its podcast, a title, a summary and cover art
    Given I am a logged in user with the "Content editor" user
     When I go to "/node/add/podcast_episode"
     Then the page title should contain "Create Podcast episode"
      And I see visible podcast title field, podcast reference field
      And the field "#edit-title-0-value" should be required
      And the field "#edit-field-podcast-0-target-id" should be required
      And the field "Summary" should be required
      And the field "Show notes" should exist
      And the field "Summary" should be empty
      And I should see "Cover art"
      And I should see "Add media"
      And I should see "Listen on"

  @regression @local @development @staging @production
  Scenario: The Audio tab offers the Audio field as a media reference, not a file upload or a link
    Given I am a logged in user with the "Content editor" user
     When I go to "/node/add/podcast_episode"
      And I open the "Audio" tab on the podcast form
     Then I see visible audio media button, duration field, episode number field
      And "#edit-field-audio-open-button" should have value "Add media"
      And I don't see audio file upload, audio link field
      And the field "Duration" should not be required
      And the field "Episode number" should not be required

  @regression @local @development @staging
  Scenario: An episode cannot be saved without the podcast it belongs to
    Given I am a logged in user with the "Content editor" user
     When I go to "/node/add/podcast_episode"
      And browser validation for the form "#node-podcast-episode-form" is disabled
      And I fill in "Title" with "Varbase Example Orphan Episode 74513"
      And I fill in "Summary" with "Summary for the orphan test episode 74513."
      And I add the first available cover art from the media library
      And I try to save the podcast episode
     Then I should see "Podcast field is required."
      And the url should match "/node/add/podcast_episode"
